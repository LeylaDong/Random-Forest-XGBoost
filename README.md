# Diabetes Analysis

1. Create a Logistic Regression model on the diabetes data set to identify if a patient has diabetes (‘Outcome’ column in the data set).

2. Create Logistic Regression models on the diabetes data set by performing a stepwise addition of the features. Identify which features are informative towards the classification and write your observations based on the same. Finally, choose the best model and explain your reasons for the same.

3. Does the FDR ('False Significance') have impact on any of the above created models? Give appropriate reasoning for your conclusions.

4. Using the dataset, create a Random Forest Classifier to classify patients with and without diabetes in the ‘outcome’ column.

5. Create another classification model using XGBoost for the same dataset.
